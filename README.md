Online Retail Data Analysis and Visualization Project

Overview
This repository contains the project completed during my internship with Tata's "Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights" program offered by Forage. The project involves analyzing an online retail dataset and creating insightful visualizations to support business decision-making.

Project Description
The primary objective of this project was to analyze online retail data and create visualizations that provide meaningful business insights. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the creation of interactive visualizations to highlight key metrics and trends.

Features
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensured the dataset was ready for analysis by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers.
Interactive Visualizations: Developed interactive and static visualizations to present the findings clearly and effectively.

Project Details
1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values by using appropriate imputation techniques.
Removed duplicate entries and standardized data formats to ensure consistency.
Used various Excel functions and Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) for data preparation.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
Analyzed sales trends over time, product performance, and customer behavior.
Created pivot tables and charts to explore data from multiple perspectives.
3. Interactive Visualizations
Developed dashboards using tools like Tableau and Power BI.
Created interactive charts and graphs to allow users to filter and interact with the data dynamically.
Visualized key metrics such as total sales, sales by product category, and customer purchase patterns.

Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: For initial data cleaning and preparation.
Python: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
Data Visualization Tools: Tableau and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Other Libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn for static visualizations.

How to Use
Clone the Repository: Download or clone the repository to access the project files.
Open Data Files: Review the cleaned dataset and initial analysis in the provided Excel and CSV files.
Explore Visualizations: Open the Tableau/Power BI files to explore the interactive dashboards and visualizations.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in uncovering insights and supporting business decisions. The interactive dashboards make it easy to explore the data and gain valuable insights into online retail performance.
